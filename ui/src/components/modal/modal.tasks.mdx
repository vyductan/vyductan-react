# Modal Component Tasks

## Current Status: âœ… Stable

The Modal component is currently stable and functional with both declarative and imperative usage patterns.

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Core Implementation
- [x] Basic Modal component with declarative API
- [x] Support for custom width (fixed and responsive)
- [x] Custom footer support
- [x] Loading states for confirm actions
- [x] Proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- [x] Integration with App context for imperative usage

### âœ… Imperative API
- [x] `modal.confirm()` method through App context
- [x] Async onOk handler support with loading states
- [x] Error handling for confirm actions
- [x] Proper cleanup and state management

### âœ… Developer Experience
- [x] Clear error messages when App context is missing
- [x] TypeScript support with proper type exports
- [x] Documentation with examples
- [x] Consistent API with Ant Design patterns

## Pending Tasks

### ðŸ”„ Enhancements (Medium Priority)

#### Modal Variants
- [ ] Add `Modal.info()` method
- [ ] Add `Modal.success()` method  
- [ ] Add `Modal.error()` method
- [ ] Add `Modal.warning()` method
- [ ] Support for custom icons in confirm dialogs

#### Styling & Theming
- [ ] Add more size presets (small, medium, large, fullscreen)
- [ ] Support for custom themes/variants
- [ ] Better responsive behavior on mobile devices
- [ ] Animation customization options

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] Modal stacking support (multiple modals)
- [ ] Draggable modal headers
- [ ] Resizable modals
- [ ] Modal positioning options (center, top, custom)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation improvements

### ðŸ”„ Integration Tasks (Low Priority)

#### Form Integration
- [ ] Better integration with Form components
- [ ] Auto-focus first form field when modal opens
- [ ] Form validation integration with modal actions

#### Accessibility Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced screen reader support
- [ ] Better focus management for complex content
- [ ] High contrast mode support
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences

## Technical Debt

### ðŸ”§ Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for App context usage
- [ ] Performance optimization for large content
- [ ] Bundle size optimization

### ðŸ”§ Documentation
- [ ] Add Storybook stories with interactive examples
- [ ] Create migration guide from other modal libraries
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Video tutorials for complex use cases

## Breaking Changes (Future)

### ðŸš¨ V2.0 Considerations
- [ ] Consider removing deprecated Modal.confirm static method entirely
- [ ] Standardize all imperative methods to use App context only
- [ ] Review and potentially simplify the props API
- [ ] Consider moving to a more composable API pattern

## Dependencies

### Required
- React 18+
- App component (for imperative usage)
- UiConfigProvider (for styling context)

### Optional
- Form components (for form integration)
- Animation library (for custom animations)

## Notes

- The Modal component follows Ant Design patterns for consistency
- All imperative methods require the App component wrapper
- The component is built on top of Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Responsive width support uses CSS-in-JS for breakpoint handling

## Migration Notes

### From Global Modal Approach
If migrating from the old global modal approach:

1. Remove any `GlobalConfirmModal` components
2. Wrap your app with `<App>` component
3. Replace `Modal.confirm()` with `App.useApp().modal.confirm()`
4. Update imports to include App component

### From Other Libraries
When migrating from other modal libraries:
- API is similar to Ant Design Modal
- Focus management is handled automatically
- No need for manual z-index management
